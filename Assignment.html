<h3> Many Goblins have suffered because they are misunderstood </h3>

<h2> My goal is to educate people on these beautiful creatures </h2>

<p> Goblins are mythical creatures that are typically tied to mischief or generally evil.
They have been made the villains very often, but are they? This is what we will find out! </p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.uesp.com">
<h2>Goblins tend to live in groups in underground caves, abandoned mines and ancient ruins, the entrances of which are often guarded and decorated with at least one stake with human skulls on it driven into the ground. 
They are the most sophisticated creatures in the game, with many goblins having a rank and job in the group.</h2>
