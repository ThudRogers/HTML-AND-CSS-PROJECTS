<blockquote cite="http://www.uesp.com">
<h5>Goblins tend to live in groups in underground caves, abandoned mines and ancient ruins, the entrances of which are often guarded and decorated with at least one stake with human skulls on it driven into the ground. 
They are the most sophisticated creatures in the game, with many goblins having a rank and job in the group.</h5>
