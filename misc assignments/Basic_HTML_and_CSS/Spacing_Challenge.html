Once upon a <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bolder">midnight</span> dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">forgotten</span> lore—<br>
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
            Only this and nothing more.”<br><br>

    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
            Nameless here for evermore.<br><br>

    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>
            This it is and nothing more.”<br><br>
